The files in this folder are makefile snippets, they can be reused across
projects without much change at all.

Features:
  uses wildcards, no need to add files to project when adding code
  works best with pkg-config based dependencies
  is just plain makefile and shellscript - feasible to understand
  dist target - creates tarball if git status . is clean
  generic script and gnu diff based test driving framework

Magic make is a project in progress, but as my need for deduplicating my build
processes grow it might be growin in capability.

How to use:
  drop a symlink into your project and include the parts needed from
  you main Makefile with import .mm/lib

Desirable todos:
  On dist: create a bundle of the included makefiles and drop it in as the
  makefile in the directory - leaving the distribution with a simpler file
  structure.

  generate a autotools environment on dist - that is dist-checked, piggy
  backing on autotools for satisfying distro people - permitting fluid build
  environment with short feed-back loop for developers.

  align variable naming with autotools - just because it can be possible?
